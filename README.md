# different widgets
Panel has a tad more widget variety, but streamlit has all the basics
one for example is the radio widget

streamlit does have built-in charts, but it's trivial to use any plotting library with panel
another thing are a bunch of specific text elements

a couple things that panel does not have are balloons and snowflakes confetti

# layout options

panel offers a tad more layout options

I was surprised to find that streamlit did not have a row layout

I did like the empty, used as a placeholder

# customizability of layout options

# dynamic generation of widgets
